		<div class="intro">
			<p> I am a current Second Year College student studying Computer Science. I focus with backend development because I do not have potential skills in terms of design and this website is just in the minimal aspect. I learned how to code about Five years ago but I only did it to kill my boredom
				<br><br>
			Back when I was a kid, I only dreamed of becoming a Civil Engineer because it's good to build stuff that people can appreciate. If I were to turn back time, I would have studied the course and maybe i am in a different lifestyle by now. Nonetheless, here I am stuck with being an ordinary student who dreams of nothing but making money.
				<br><br>
			Right now, I specialize in database management, DevOps (microservices), and minor at full stack.</p>
